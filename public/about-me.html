                <h2>My name is Uzair and living the simple life just saved my life</h2>
                <p>The website motto is: <span>The happiest people don’t have the best of everything, they just make the best of what they have.</span> It actually doesn’t take a lot to be happy most of the time.</p>
                <p>When I was a student studying for my degree, we had very little. But it was some of the happiest years of my life.</p>
                <p>When we had no other option than making do with what we had – we didn’t focus on getting the next best thing. We just enjoyed it – and it was free-ing!</p>
                <p>This was one of the best life lessons to have learnt – and was almost more valuable than my degree!</p>
